# External combat effects catalog — separate research track

**Status: PARTIAL, R2a discovery infrastructure and first native findings.** Phase 6 is complete and closed. This track does not reopen, supersede, recalibrate or change Phase 6, its Stage behavior, accepted family integrations, or production combat. Original Phase 7 is not started by this research.

Baseline: `a5e85e610349120e21d62f4a80f1b607e36607fe`. Branch: `external-effects-catalog-research`. Recovery found a clean working tree and the live readiness remote at this baseline; no earlier external-effects track existed. No applicable `AGENTS.md` was found. The dedicated branch was created from the verified baseline without resetting or discarding work.

The owner confirmed the installed instance at `C:/Users/youra/curseforge/minecraft/Instances/new`. The source directory is its `mods/` folder. Exact requested filenames, SHA-256 hashes, archive/class counts, version metadata, damage resources and mixin configuration names are recorded in [jar-inventory.json](benchmarks/external-effects-catalog/jar-inventory.json). Other instances and newer/older versions are not substituted. An inventory check is not a completed mechanical inspection.

**R1 inventory result: 23/23 exact target filenames available; zero unavailable.** Embedded metadata is preserved rather than silently normalized: Royal Variations declares `2.0` inside the requested `2.0.4` file, Darkest Souls declares `1.2.3.1` inside the requested `v1.2.3.3` file, and Legendary Monsters declares `1.21.1` as its mod version. Nether Expansion also has a shorter internal version than its filename. These are discrepancies in the exact installed files, not version substitutions. JAR SHA-256 identity controls subsequent inspection.

Four existing-compat candidates are pinned separately: `antarchy_tensura_compat-1.0.0.jar`, `tensura_iaf-neoforge-2.0.0.1.jar`, `rarcompat-1.21-0.9.7.jar`, and `ftb-xmod-compat-neoforge-21.1.9.jar`. R2 must determine their actual relevance and modifications; a filename alone does not establish behavior. These four are additional context JARs, not extra members of the 23 requested targets.

## Scope and method

The target is distinct **mechanics and materially distinct delivery paths**, not weapon count or effect names. Discovery must cover registered MobEffects, direct vanilla effects, attributes, events, callbacks, custom damage/source tags, projectiles/explosions, entity state, timers/stacks/buildup, healing/resource mutations, action/AI suppression, items/enchantments/accessories and skills. Cosmetic code and ordinary physical damage are excluded only after their behavior is assessed. Registry/keyword scans are candidate discovery aids, not completeness proof.

Every included effect will retain exact JAR/class/method evidence, behavior and numerical parameters, vanilla similarities/differences, flags for custom state/attributes/source/stack/buildup/threshold/immunity/removal, duration/strength semantics, legitimate source(s), and distinct delivery paths. Primary classification uses exactly one of the owner's ten categories. A pending review is marked unverified with no final classification; `REVIEW_REQUIRED` is reserved for actual unresolved evidence ambiguity, not work that has not been inspected.

Base Tensura 2.0.1.1 is a reference authority. Its six completed native TNO families are recorded as `TENSURA_NATIVE_EXISTING_TNO_COVERAGE`, with immutable accepted references and no repeated research. Tensura addons are reviewed for additional mechanics, keeping their use of base native helpers explicit. Existing compatibility-layer modifications are separately attributed; native source behavior is not inferred from a compatibility patch.

Minecraft 1.21.1 comparison will use implementation, including relevant native attributes, damage tags and control flow. Local mapped NeoForge artifacts are pinned as reference aids; where patches could matter, raw vanilla must be distinguished from loader changes. Names, icons and wiki descriptions are not authority.

Only parameter availability is observed. No Stage formulas or integration choices are made. There will be no boss/L2 tests, balance changes, compatibility fixes or production Java in this track.

## Artifact structure

| Artifact | R1 meaning |
|---|---|
| `jar-inventory.json` | Exact installed identities and metadata; availability established separately from mechanical discovery |
| `effect-catalog.json` | Per-mechanic catalog; empty at R1 means not discovered yet |
| `effect-sources.json` | Legitimate primary/alternate sources and code-proven equivalence groups |
| `delivery-path-matrix.json` | Distinct native delivery implementations, not merely delivery labels |
| `vanilla-comparison.json` | Actual behavior comparisons and primary classifications |
| `behavior-primitives.json` | Shared primitive grouping while preserving semantic distinctions |
| `research-decision.json` | Honest partial/final status, immutable baseline, boundaries and exact next task |

The final human table will contain mod, mechanic, registry ID, classification, actual behavior, vanilla equivalent/differences, numerical/scalable/binary parameters, delivery, primary/alternate test sources, implementation, existing compat modification, confidence and notes. The second matrix will group behavior primitives with their concrete implementations and minimum future source coverage. Neither table is complete at R1.

## Checkpoint ledger

| Checkpoint | State |
|---|---|
| R1 | Complete, pushed and live-verified: `1a362b65e075177f78792cbad12fb979203f2890` |
| R2a | Partial protected increment: all external outer-JAR classes scanned, source aids prepared, first six provisional native findings pinned; not R2 completion |
| R2 | In progress: semantic discovery across every available external target, including non-MobEffect mechanics and compatibility candidates |
| R3 | Pending: vanilla comparisons, classifications, code-proven deduplication and complete delivery/source mapping |
| R4 | Pending: final validation, report and owner-review decision |

## R2a partial discovery evidence

All 22 external target JARs and four compatibility candidates were scanned at class/member/instruction level: **18,601 parsed classes, zero class parse failures**. The broad filter produced 14,662 candidate classes and 85,421 candidate methods. These deliberately over-inclusive counts include harmless helpers/rendering and **are not distinct effect counts**. Base Tensura was not broadly rescanned. Six nested archives remain explicitly unverified. Nine JSON parsing failures are recorded (eight Mowzie world-generation resources and one ArPhEx dimension-type resource); none are silently omitted from the audit.

[discovery-audit.json](benchmarks/external-effects-catalog/discovery-audit.json) records identities, counts, nested archives and decompiler caveats. Source aids for all 26 scanned outer JARs were prepared with pinned Vineflower 1.10.1. Successful decompiler exit is insufficient: failed method bodies and warning markers remain listed for bytecode follow-up, including ArPhEx `DwellerLifestealProcedure`. Large reproducible indexes/source aids stay under ignored `run/external-effects-catalog/`; locator hashes, research tooling and reviewed bytecode witnesses are committed. No mod JAR or whole decompiled source tree is committed.

The research class reader passed five tests: JDK disassembler agreement on instruction offsets including dense/sparse switch, wide locals, invokedynamic, interface calls, multidimensional arrays and wide constants; modified UTF-8 constants; malformed class rejection; malformed opcode rejection; and five installed Variants & Ventures classes cross-checked against `javap`. These validate tooling, not gameplay.

The first [native findings](benchmarks/external-effects-catalog/native-findings/variantsandventures.json) are pinned to 14 installed class/resource witnesses. They remain provisional entries with no final R3 classification:

| Mod | Native finding | Proven behavior / parameters | Distinct source paths | Pending comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Variants & Ventures | Poison payload (`minecraft:poison`) | Constructs duration 100, amplifier 0 | Thicket successful unarmed melee; Verdant native Arrow payload | Arrow target duration, native Poison ticking/eligibility/merging |
| Variants & Ventures | Gelid frozen-timer assignment | Absolute `setTicksFrozen(240)`; snowball also requests 4 thrown-source damage | Eligible successful unarmed melee; owned native snowball callback without the same eligibility/hurt-return checks | Native callback chain, timer decay, freeze protection and damage admission; timer is not asserted to be a 12-second stun |
| Variants & Ventures | Thicket Poison rejection | `canBeAffected` rejects POISON | Recipient eligibility override | Whether redundant with native undead protection |
| Variants & Ventures | Freeze eligibility overrides | Murk/Verdant false-return overrides; Zombie mixin false-return shim; Gelid powder-snow entity-type flag | Multiple distinct recipient implementations | Native freeze handling, mixin hierarchy and final deduplication |
| Variants & Ventures | Murk underwater arrow inertia | Owner-specific water inertia return `0.99F` | Native Murk bow projectile in water | Actual vanilla inertia/use; may remain delivery-only rather than standalone effect |
| Variants & Ventures | Zombie conversion to Gelid | 140 exposure threshold, 300 countdown, converts below zero; exit resets exposure/cancels conversion | Native powder-snow environment | Native conversion preservation and final treatment as effect versus source prerequisite |

These six are **not** a final count of distinct mechanics or proof the mod is fully covered. `effect-catalog.json` carries their native parameters, flags, method references, prospective sources and pending questions. Source/delivery/vanilla/primitive matrices remain incomplete. `REVIEW_REQUIRED` has not been used to label ordinary unfinished work.

The separately pinned [Antarchy compatibility data](benchmarks/external-effects-catalog/compat-findings/antarchy-tensura-data.json) establishes a `PRESENT` data contribution: 29 Tensura `entity_existence` definitions and zero Java classes. Values include declared SHP, magicule/aura ranges and optional Tensura ability IDs. These declarations belong to the compatibility layer. Loader interpretation and pack resource precedence still need inspection; no runtime resource amounts or skill activation are claimed from JSON alone.

Validation of the research boundary compares every pre-existing tracked file to `a5e85e610349120e21d62f4a80f1b607e36607fe`; only new research docs/evidence/tooling are allowed. A generated Python cache accidentally included in R1 is removed from tracking in R2a and locally ignored; its local file is preserved. Production, Stage, accepted Phase 6/readiness files and runtime remain unchanged.

Exact next task after protecting R2a: continue semantic discovery from these saved indexes and findings. Finish Variants & Ventures candidate/exclusion coverage and native prerequisites; review the remaining external mods, nested archives and relevant failed decompiler methods. Resolve the nine resource parsing anomalies and existing compat attribution. Do not rerun accepted R1 or Phase 6 research. R2, R3 and R4 are unfinished, and the owner-review decision is not yet available.
